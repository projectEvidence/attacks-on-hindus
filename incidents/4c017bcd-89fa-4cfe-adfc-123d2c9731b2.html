Though Dr. Sen formally submitted his resignation on Friday night citing age-related reasons, the context of the decision paints a far darker picture. For days, a faction of students operating under the banner “General Students’ Anti-Discrimination Movement, Premier University” staged escalating demonstrations demanding the removal of Dr. Sen, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, and the Treasurer. Their actions included locking the gates of three campuses, including the main GEC campus — an aggressive tactic that disrupted academic operations and created a climate of intimidation. The protesters accused Dr. Sen of harboring political affiliations, labeling him as an “oppressor” and “enemy of the revolution” due to his advisory role in the ruling Awami League and his perceived opposition to the so-called July revolution. These accusations, devoid of any academic or administrative justification, were clearly politically motivated and rooted in ideological intolerance. Despite his decades-long contributions to education and social science, Dr. Sen, a member of Bangladesh’s Hindu minority, was vilified and hounded into resignation. His 50+ years of teaching excellence and his leadership since 2006 at Premier University were cast aside by a radical faction unwilling to tolerate diverse views or respect his legacy. Dr. Sen’s resignation was announced during an academic council meeting, where he reportedly shared his decision with department heads under palpable pressure from the ongoing protests and the threat of more “intensified” agitation planned for Saturday. This incident is a sobering reminder of how a mob-driven atmosphere — fueled by hostility, intolerance, and political opportunism — can unjustly topple even the most respected figures in academia. It reflects not only a personal loss for Dr. Sen, but a dangerous precedent where reason is drowned out by radicalism, and a Hindu scholar is forced out not for wrongdoing, but for who he is and what he represents."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
