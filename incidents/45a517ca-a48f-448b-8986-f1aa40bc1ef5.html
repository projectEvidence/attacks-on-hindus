Miscreants attacked a temple in the capital&#39;s Turag and vandalized two idols. The incident took place at Sholohati Sarbajanin Durga temple in Sector 18 on Thursday morning. A case has been filed with Turag Police Station in this connection, but no arrests have been made so far. Mohammad Rahat Khan, officer-in-charge (OC) of Turag Police Station of DMP, confirmed the information. Palash Sarkar, son of Shanti Babu, president of Sholohati Sarbajanin Durga Mandir, said some people came in a white private car around 4:45am and attacked the temple and vandalized the idol and fled. ’ Palash Sarkar said, &quot;After the immersion of the Durga idol after Durga Puja, we keep the Saraswati idol instead of leaving the temple empty. A few days ago, there was Saraswati Puja, due to which we made that idol new. It was attacked and vandalized and left upside down. ’ Palash Sarkar said the guard of a cattle farm next to the temple first saw the attack. &quot;The guard, thinking the attackers might have weapons, did not stop alone, but went to call people,&quot; he said. When he returned, he found the attackers had fled. ’ &quot;We called 999 after receiving the news of the attack on the temple. Then the police came. In the morning, the OC, AC and DC sir of the police station came. Then they saw and took pictures. At the same time, they assured to take action. ’ Turag Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mohammad Rahat Khan said, &quot;Two people came in a white private car and attacked them. A case was filed with the police station in this connection. ’ OC Rahat said, &quot;No one has been arrested or arrested in this connection. We are trying to collect CCTV camera footage to identify the attackers. ’"> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
