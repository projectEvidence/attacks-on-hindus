Four days after the incident, his body was found floating in the Guliahali beach area of ​​Muradpur union in Sitakunda upazila on Friday morning. Ram Jaldas&#39;s home is in Jelepara of Madhyam Mahmudabad village in Barabkunda union of the upazila. After preparing the post-mortem report, his body will be sent to the morgue of Chittagong Medical College Hospital for autopsy. Waliuddin Akbar, inspector of Kumira naval police outpost, told Prothom Alo that Ram Jaldas&#39; body was found floating in the Guliahali beach in the tidal water. Local fishermen saw the body lying in the mud as the water receded at low tide. They later informed the relatives of the deceased. After receiving information from relatives, members of the Naval Police went to the spot and recovered the body of Ram Jaldas. According to police sources, Ram Jaldas went fishing in the sea with his younger brother Liton Jaldas around 10:30 am on Monday. At that time, some people were illegally using a dredger machine to fill the bulkhead (sand-carrying vessel) with sand from very close to their net. A net of fishermen got tangled in the propeller of the bulkhead. Ram Jaldas protested while cutting the net. At that time, the people involved in sand extraction got angry and hit Ram Jaldas on the head. Later, they beat him and threw him into the sea. Since then, Ram Jaldas has been missing. After throwing Ram Jaldas into the sea, his younger brother Liton Jaldas was also kidnapped and taken to the Chairmanghat area of ​​Hatia upazila of Noakhali district by the people involved in sand extraction. Later, members of the Naval Police rescued Liton Jaldas. Ram Jaldas&#39; wife Kanika Jaldas has filed a case of murder and kidnapping in the incident. The naval police have arrested six people involved in the incident.
