The attack follows a series of prior harassment incidents, including stone pelting, smear attacks with human excreta, and nighttime intimidation — all aimed at terrorizing the Hindu Haldar family. The fire broke out around 11:30 PM and continued until 1:00 AM, completely burning haystacks, stored firewood, and the cowshed located within the compound of Nirmal Haldar’s family home. The total damage is estimated to be over 4 lakh Bangladeshi taka (~$3,500 USD). The fire was brought under control only with the help of local residents and the Kaliganj Fire Service. Family members believe this was a deliberate communal act intended to spread fear. Notably, this attack occurred after repeated earlier incidents, where unknown perpetrators: Smeared feces on kitchen windows Pelted the tin-roofed house and upper floors with bricks Threatened the family with psychological and material harm Despite these incidents, no effective action was taken, and Thursday night’s fire marks the most violent escalation. The victims include Prashanta Haldar, a well-known dramatist and founder of the Dhaka-based theater group Anuswar, and his sister Shraboni Rakhi, a journalist. Upon hearing the news, they rushed from Dhaka to be with their aging father and uncle, who live in the home along with a few women and a younger sibling. According to Prashanta Haldar: “The fire began behind our two-story home, in a shed where hay and fuelwood were kept. It quickly spread to the cowshed and storage area. If the flames had reached the main house, it could’ve taken lives. We’re devastated, and the motive is clearly malicious.” Shraboni Rakhi expressed concern over the safety of her elderly father and uncle, noting that the family had no known enmity with anyone. She emphasized: “This is not an accident. Someone did this with the clear intention to harm or frighten us. We’ve sought legal help.” Following the arson, Kaliganj police and the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Dedarul Islam visited the scene. A formal written complaint was lodged with the police by Prashanta Haldar, who detailed the prior incidents of communal-style harassment that preceded the arson attack. Despite the mounting evidence of targeted abuse, the police have not yet arrested any suspects. Locals remain tight-lipped, possibly out of fear or complicity. Kaliganj Police OC Shahidul Islam Hawlader confirmed: “We have received a complaint and are investigating the matter. Legal action will follow based on findings.” This incident adds to the growing list of intimidation and violence faced by religious minorities, particularly Hindus, in rural Bangladesh, where perpetrators often go unpunished and victims live in fear and silence."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
