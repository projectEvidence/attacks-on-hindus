A Saraswati idol was vandalised at a Kali temple in Faridpur just three days before the start of Saraswati Puja. A youth has been arrested in connection with the incident. Saraswati Puja will be celebrated on February 3. The incident took place at the Kali temple in the Bhatilakshmipur area of the district around 11 p.m. on Friday. Faridpur Kotwali police arrested the youth around 12:30 a.m. and took him to the police station. Police identified the arrested youth as Md. Mirajuddin. He earns a living by driving an easybike. Miraj, a resident of Bajedpur village in Basantpur Union of Rajbari Sadar Upazila, currently lives in a rented house at the Rajbari Road intersection. Ramchandra Malo, a member of the temple committee, said, “Our temple is beside the road in Bhatilakshmipur. An easybike stopped in front of the temple shortly before 11 p.m. on Friday night. The driver then entered the verandah of the temple, pushed the Saraswati idol, and vandalised it. Later, locals caught him and handed him over to the police.” Earlier, the same individual (Mirajuddin) had broken the Saraswati idol at Faridpur Sri Sri Radhagovinda ISKCON temple. Ramchandra Malo claimed that he was let off as &quot;insane&quot; after the incident on February 7, 2024. Meanwhile, a 26-second CCTV footage provided by the temple committee has confirmed the incident. Samar Mondal, a student of Government Rajendra College, said, “The idol was made by a potter under a contract of Tk 6,000. We students, who stay in a hostel next to this temple, had planned to celebrate Saraswati Puja together. I had also invited many friends. But the idol was broken at such a time that there is no longer enough time to repair it.” Faridpur Kotwali Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Asaduzzaman said, “The arrested youth is currently in police custody.” Faridpur Additional Superintendent of Police (Crime and Operations) Sailen Chakma added, “A member of the temple committee is preparing to file a case. After the case is filed, the young man will be formally arrested and sent to court.”"> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
