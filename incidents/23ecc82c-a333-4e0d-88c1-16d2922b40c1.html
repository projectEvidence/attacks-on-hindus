Sujit Roy said, &quot;I was getting news of the vandalism of the houses of Awami League leaders in Koyra upazila headquarters since yesterday afternoon. I was already scared. Then in the evening, when I heard that a group of people were coming to attack my house, I took everyone in the house and went to another house a little further away. As I was going, I heard the sound of vandalism in the house. Starting from the roof of the house, everything inside the house was broken.&quot;"/>
