He has established a kingdom in the area by freely occupying land. ACC sources have given this information. Information about huge wealth in the name and anonymity of Sadeq Khan has been found in a secret investigation by the ACC&#39;s Intelligence Branch. He has built wealth in his own name and in the names of his family members and relatives through various irregularities and corruption. The legal source of these assets could not be found. Sources said that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has decided to investigate allegations of abuse of power, irregularities, and amassing wealth beyond known sources of income through corruption against Sadeq Khan and another MP and the Vice-Chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Digital University in Gazipur. The commission took this decision yesterday, Sunday. A public investigation will begin against them soon. Sadeq Khan became an Awami League MP from Dhaka-13 constituency in the 11th National Parliament election. He had been carrying out coercive activities including encroachment since before. After becoming an MP, he became reckless in grabbing land belonging to the Hindu community."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
