Information about huge wealth in the name and anonymity of Sadeq Khan has been found in a secret investigation by the ACC&#39;s Intelligence Branch. He has built wealth in his own name and in the names of his family members and relatives through various irregularities and corruption. The legal source of these assets could not be found. Sources said that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has decided to investigate allegations of abuse of power, irregularities, and amassing wealth beyond known sources of income through corruption against Sadeq Khan and another MP and the Vice-Chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Digital University in Gazipur. The commission took this decision yesterday, Sunday. A public investigation will begin against them soon. Sadeq Khan became an Awami League MP from Dhaka-13 constituency in the 11th National Parliament election. He had been carrying out coercive activities including encroachment since before.
