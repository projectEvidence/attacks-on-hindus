During this time, female passengers were also molested and raped, the passengers on the bus alleged. Based on the passengers&#39; complaints, the Natore police have arrested the driver, the driver&#39;s assistant and the supervisor of the bus and handed them over to the court. It is learnt that they have been released on bail from there. BBC Bangla spoke to two of the passengers who were on the bus last Monday (February 17) night. They allege that at least one person was raped on the bus that night. Since the bus was in motion, the names of multiple places are emerging in this incident. Notable among them are Baraigram in Natore and Mirzapur police stations in Tangail. Testimonies of passengers: 22-year-old Sohag Hasan is a businessman. His home is in Baraigram. Omar Ali from this village and he had gone to Dhaka together on business. That day, when it was late to finish work, they hurriedly boarded the bus. He said that even though the car was loaded with passengers, the driver and his accomplices put seven or eight more people in the car halfway and then one of them sat in the driver&#39;s seat. The rest of the group then approached the passengers and held knives to their throats. They had forbidden them to turn on the bus lights, he said. &quot;And the biggest thing is, they were standing in front of everyone with knives. They even stabbed five or six people. Out of fear, no one said anything. Everyone had their heads down. They were saying, &#39;Keep your eyes closed. If you look, I will cut your eyes off,&#39;&quot; he added. Sohag Hasan and Omar Ali had 120,000 taka. When the robbers asked, they initially gave 20,000 taka. But the driver and his assistants &quot;showed&quot; the robbers that they had more money, Mr. Hasan claimed. &quot;Because I didn&#39;t want to pay, they threw me down and held me on my chest until I paid. And they kept me down until I got off the bus.&quot; At that time, they couldn&#39;t speak, couldn&#39;t raise their heads, couldn&#39;t open their eyes. All they could hear were the screams and cries of two female passengers on the bus. &quot;Their seats were in the middle of the bus. There was a Hindu in between them, and her husband was with her,&quot; said Mr. Hasan. The robbers first took everything the woman had. &quot;Then, right in front of us, a boy dragged the woman to the back seat and forcibly took her away. When her husband tried to stop her, he beat her up a lot,&quot; said Sohag Hasan. &quot;They also raped her. When they took her back, she was screaming a lot. They wouldn&#39;t let us go. We could only hear the screams. She was crying loudly. But there was nothing we could do there.&quot; Pausing, he added, &quot;No one would scream like that if they hadn&#39;t raped her.&quot; Majnu Akand, a 73-year-old jaggery trader, was also on the bus that day. He also said, &quot;The screaming we heard that night... the respect of our mother and sister... we had no words inside the car. They were hurting their dignity, they were fighting.&quot; He also said that two women were the most tortured. One was about 20 years old, the other 25-30 years old. Stating that &quot;I don&#39;t know whether the two women complained of rape or not&quot; at the police station, he said, &quot;We know that two people were tortured inside the car.&quot; Regarding the second woman being talked about, Sohag Hasan said, &quot;Another woman, probably 25-30 years old. She took everything. She was two seats in front of us. They wouldn&#39;t let us look. She was touching different parts of her body. When we were going to protest again and again, they tried to beat us. They took only the Hindu girl in the back of the bus and sexually assaulted her&quot;. Police denies rape: Meanwhile, passengers say that at least one rape incident occurred on the bus that night. But the OCs of Baraigram and Mirzapur, both police stations, say they are not aware of any such incident. Baraigram OC Sirajul Islam told the BBC, &quot;I have not found any information about rape. No one has told me about any such incident or I have not found any witnesses.&quot; And Mr. Islam was quoted by the Mirzapur OC as saying, &quot;Many people are talking about rape. But I do not know anything about it. The Baraigram OC said that nothing like this happened.&quot; News source: https://www.bbc.com/bengali/articles/cjd35n58y7jo" /> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
