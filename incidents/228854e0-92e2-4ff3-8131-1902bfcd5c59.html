On Friday, the injured priest, Brahman Jamenikanta Mohanta (80), was initially sent to the Upazila Health Complex. From there, doctors referred him to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital. The police were given a young man named Rifat Hossain (20), from the same union&#39;s Shalandhar Mondolpara village, who was involved in the incident, by the villagers. He has been arrested under section 151 and sent to court. He is a first-year student at a local college. Police were later deployed at the scene to continue the event. Manik Chandra Ray, a schoolteacher and son of the event&#39;s chairman Pradip Ray, stated that the villagers organized a two-day event (Ashtaprahari) as usual. During the event on Friday, Rifat attacked the Brahman with a screwdriver, injuring his head. He was taken to the hospital in a bleeding condition. After the incident, local BNP union president Md. Afsar Ali and general secretary Ekram rushed to the scene. After the incident, the Union BNP president Md. Afsar Ali and general secretary Ekramul along with local residents rushed to the spot. At this time, Rifat was handed over to the police. Like other similar attacks on Hindus, muslim people claimed that Rifat has been suffering from mental health issue to evade justice. His medical papers have been sent to the police station. To ensure that there are no problems in conducting the ritual ceremony, the BNP has taken necessary measures. Duty officer Phul Mia of the Parbatipur Model Police Station said that a young man named Rifat Hossain was brought to the police station in connection with the attack on Brahman. His family brought documents for mental health treatment. He has been arrested under section 151 and sent to court."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
