Ajit Sarkar sought refuge in the house of his neighbor Mortuza Mia to save his life. He was taken from there and dragged around Mahishaunda Bazar and forced to wear a garland made of shoes for being a witness in the case. Then, four or five people, including Lavlu, killed him on the river bank and dumped his body. On the evening of August 8, when the body was found floating downstream, Lavlu&#39;s nephew Moizuddin chopped it into pieces and dumped it a few kilometers away.</div> <div class="lead fw-bold">Involved Crimes</div> <div class="mb-4"> <ul class="list-group"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Murder</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Loot</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; House Vandalism</li> </ul> </div> <div class="lead fw-bold">Proofs</div> <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered mb-4"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0"> <div> <a href="https://www.khaborerkagoj.com/country/824218" target="_blank">Proof on www.khaborerkagoj.com</a> </div> </li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0"> <div> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLPrpRKUemIQmwbTpZohYUMWIbWxnlYj/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Proof on drive.google.com</a> </div> </li> </ul> <div class="lead fw-bold">Victims</div> <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered mb-4"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0"> <div><div> <strong>Name:</strong> Ajit Sarkar</div> <div> <strong>Gender:</strong> Male</div> <div> <strong>Suffered Crimes</strong> </div> <ul class="list-group"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Murder</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Loot</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; House Vandalism</li> </ul> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </body> </html>
