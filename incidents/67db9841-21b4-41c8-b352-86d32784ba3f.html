A medicine trader named Uttam Kumar Biswas (48) has reportedly gone missing after going to collect money owed to him in the Panchlaish area of Chattogram, according to his family. It is reported that on the morning of January 5, Uttam left his residence at Probita House, Mimi Residential area in Probartak Mor, citing work-related reasons, but never returned home. Attempts to contact him via his mobile phone were unsuccessful, as the phone was found switched off. Following this, his wife Banasree Hor (44) filed a General Diary (GD) at Panchlaish Police Station. Speaking to reporters, Uttam’s brother-in-law said that Uttam owns a pharmacy named Khaja Pharmacy beside Nasirabad Hill View. Uttam had told his wife that he needed to go to Feni to collect some money but did not specify how much or from whom. Around 5:00 PM that day, when his wife called him, he said, “The work isn’t finished yet, I’ll talk later,” and hung up. Ten minutes later, Uttam called his wife again, informing her that the person who owed him money had not paid yet, and that he might have to stay overnight. If that happened, he promised to inform her. However, his phone was found switched off that night. His brother-in-law further mentioned that Uttam had dealings with someone about going to Poland a year ago, but he didn’t know the exact amount involved. According to employees of neighboring shops, the figure could be around 500,000 BDT, of which 200,000 BDT was reportedly recovered. However, his sister (Uttam’s wife) claimed she had no knowledge of these dealings. Police informed them that Uttam’s last known location was in Matiranga on January 5, but even after searches, he was not found. The investigating officer, Sub-Inspector Mohammad Mostafizur Rahman, stated, “He is not missing; he left the house voluntarily.” Panchlaish Police Station’s Officer-in-Charge (OC), Md. Solaiman, said, “He is staging this drama. Many people are owed money by him, and we suspect he has gone into hiding to avoid repaying them.” However, the OC could not specify exactly how many creditors were involved. Further investigation is ongoing."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
