The name of the hotel is &quot;Govindas Kitchen&quot;. The hotel serves vegetarian food. No mainstream media reported the incident. Quoted from the source https://sanatanprabhat.org/english/125243.html: 1. According to eyewitnesses, a post circulated on social media led to the attack on the restaurant’s staff, manager and owner by jihadi Muslims. Several people were injured. 2. The attack on the restaurant was mainly due to a provocative post spread by a Facebook account named ‘Paradoxical Sajid’, which was about beef. The post called for a boycott of vegetarian restaurants run by ‘ISKCON’, claiming that these restaurants are centres for spreading Hindutva ideology. 3. The post called on people to ‘not rent out property to ISKCON to run restaurants’, and also alleged that ISKCON restaurants mix cow urine and cow dung in their recipes. The restaurant was attacked because of this post. 4. ‘Govinda’s Kitchen’ was a popular restaurant, known for its affordable vegetarian food. The customers here were not only Hindus, but also Muslims from low-income groups. False propaganda that Hindu restaurants are hide-outs for Hindu terrorists ! It is alleged that various provocative posts were spread to create an atmosphere for attacking Govinda’s Hotel. The posts claimed: &quot;conspiracies are being hatched through Hindu restaurants in Bangladesh. Hindu terrorists have set up hideouts in these restaurants and these restaurants are working as branches of Indian intelligence agencies&quot;. ‘Rajdhani Hotel’ of a pro-Hindu Muslim also attacked In the same way that ‘Govinda’s Kitchen’ was attacked, the ‘Rajdhani Hotel’ in Dhaka was also attacked. This restaurant is owned by a Muslim and was sympathetic towards Hindus and this restaurant was attacked because it did not serve beef."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
