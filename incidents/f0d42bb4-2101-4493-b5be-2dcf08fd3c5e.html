Police have arrested three leaders of the banned Chhatra League in this incident. The brief statement of the case states that there is a temple called &#39;Shri Sri Hare Krishna Namahatta Sangha&#39; in Ranibazar Haludpatti. The plaintiff is a member of the Sangha. Last Wednesday at around 8:30 am, some members including Pranay went to clean the temple. They returned after finishing their work at around 9:30 am. On Friday, around 5 pm, after hearing about the attack, they went to the temple and found that the door and lock were broken. When they went inside, they found that six pictures of the Lord, conch, achamanpatra, mridangam, sofa, chair, table, clock and Thakur&#39;s throne kept in the temple had been vandalized. Everything was lying on the ground. Bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums kept in a box at the temple were stolen. The complaint mentions a loss of 4 million taka. Plaintiff Pranay Karmakar told Prothom Alo that ISKCON has many branch associations. Sri Sri Hare Krishna Namahatta Sangha is the propaganda branch of ISKCON. The Bhairav ​​Sangha was established in 2009. Temple activities are also conducted here. Regular prayers are held on Sundays. Bhairav ​​activities are being conducted from the ISKCON Narsingdi branch. After investigation, it was learned that the activities of the Sangha are conducted in a one-story building of a businessman in Ranibazar Haludpatti. Prayers and kirtan are held in the Sangha every Sunday. Apart from that, the Sangha office is not open much on other days. It was closed yesterday as well. Around 5 pm, some people came there and started shouting slogans like &#39;ISKCON has no place in Bhairav&#39;. Almost all of them had sticks in their hands. Later, they vandalized and left. Most of the attackers were young people. There were 15 to 20 people in number."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
