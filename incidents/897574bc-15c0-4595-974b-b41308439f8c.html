The incident happened around 9:00pm at Nayarhat Bazaar Swarnapotti, known for its numerous gold jewellery shops. According to witnesses, three armed men arrived in a white car and detonated crude bombs to create panic. They then approached Dilip, who was about to close his shop, and stabbed him indiscriminately before snatching the bag of gold he was carrying. His wife was with him at the time. The criminals detonated more crude bombs before fleeing the scene in their vehicle. Dilip was rushed to Enam Medical College Hospital in critical condition, but he succumbed to his injuries during treatment. His wife, Saraswati Das, said, &quot;The armed men hacked my husband to death and looted 20 to 25 bhori of gold in his bag right in front of me.&quot; Dr Merajur Rayhan, emergency medical officer at Enam Medical College Hospital, told The Daily Star that Dilip had suffered severe injuries to his chest, face, and multiple parts of his body. &quot;We started treatment immediately, but he died due to excessive bleeding,&quot; he said.
