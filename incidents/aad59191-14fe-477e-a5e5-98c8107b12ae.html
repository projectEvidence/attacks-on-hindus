The assault took place on Thursday, May 15, 2025, during a pre-planned attack rooted in a dispute over school land. According to eyewitnesses and the formal complaint lodged by the victim, a land-related conversation turned violent when Gobinda Chandra Pal went to inspect a 16-decimal plot of land located behind the school—land that was under negotiation for purchase by the school. As tensions flared between two parties over harvesting crops from the disputed land, the headmaster responded to a call from the school only to be ambushed by a group of attackers. The assailants, armed with local weapons, hurled communal abuses, issued death threats, and launched a violent assault, robbing him of two lakh taka that he had with him at the time. The victim was left seriously injured and was rushed to the Rajarhat Upazila Health Complex by fellow teachers, students, and residents. The attackers, according to locals, had acted with prior intention to harm the Hindu educator, using the land dispute as a cover for a communal attack. In response, the teachers, students, parents, and conscious locals organized a massive protest and human chain demonstration on Sunday, May 18, at Sonali Bank intersection in Rajarhat. Demonstrators carried placards and raised slogans, demanding immediate arrest and punishment of the attackers. Protesters—including teachers Shahidul Islam, Laxmikanta Roy, Aysha Begum, and students like Baishakhi and Jharna—delivered speeches condemning the assault and urged authorities to ensure justice for the Hindu teacher. A formal written complaint was filed by Gobinda Chandra Pal at Rajarhat Police Station, naming four attackers including Azad Ali. However, no arrests have been made yet, and the community fears a deliberate delay in legal proceedings. Rajarhat Police Officer-in-Charge Md. Taslim Uddin confirmed receiving the complaint and stated that action would be taken based on the investigation report. The incident has deeply shaken the local Hindu community and raised concerns about the increasing pattern of land-related communal attacks against minority Hindus in rural Bangladesh. The attack on a respected Hindu educator, in broad daylight, underscores the vulnerability of religious minorities and the urgent need for state protection and legal accountability."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
