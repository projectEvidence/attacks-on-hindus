Police recovered the body from the Gorai River in Pushamla village of the upazila on Thursday afternoon. He had gone missing at the local jungle market on February 14. The name of the recovered body is Utpal Kumar Biswas (45). He is the son of Birendra Nath Biswas of Pushamla village in Jungle Union of Baliakandi Upazila. He was a farmer. Some locals said that after seeing the throat slit body of an unidentified man stuck in the Magura side of the Gorai River in Pushamla village, the locals informed the Baliakandi Police Station and the Sreepur Police Station of the neighboring Magura. Since it was in Baliakandi, the Baliakandi Police Station and the Faridpur Naval Police arrived and recovered the body. On receiving the information, the family members went and identified the body of Utpal Kumar Biswas. According to family and police sources, Utpal Kumar Biswas left his house on February 14 to watch the Mahanama Yajna at the local jungle market. When he did not return home at night, his family members started searching for him. On February 15, Utpal Kumar Biswas&#39; elder brother Gautam Kumar Biswas filed a general diary (GD) at Baliakandi Police Station. Baliakandi Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Md. Jamal Uddin told Prothom Alo that Utpal Kumar Biswas used to work in agriculture. He is alleged to be a regional leader of the banned extremist Sarbahara Dal and a member of Shishir Bahini. However, there is no case against him at the police station. It is believed that professional killers killed him. After the body was examined, it was sent to the Rajbari Sadar Hospital morgue for an autopsy. Preparations are underway for a murder case in this incident at the police station.
