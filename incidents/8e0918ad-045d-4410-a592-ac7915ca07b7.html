There have been allegations of an attack on a bus in Kurigram on their way to participate in a rally in Rangpur to raise the demands of the Hindu community. Hindu community leaders have claimed that 20 people were injured in the incident on Friday afternoon. They alleged that some of the buses that were reserved for participating in the rally were stopped and turned back. After stopping some buses, the passengers blocked the road and protested, but the law enforcement agencies allowed them to go. Earlier, the ‘Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatani Jagran Jote’ did not get permission to hold a divisional rally at the Zilla School ground in Rangpur city with eight demands. However, the organization has been asked to hold a rally at Mahiganj Degree College ground, far from the city, today, Friday afternoon. After the student uprising on August 5, the &#39;Sanatan Jagran Mancha&#39; has been protesting all over the country demanding justice for the torture, oppression and attacks on the Hindu community and monasteries. On November 17, Bangladesh Sanatan Jagran Mancha and Bangladesh Sammilit Minanglaghu Jote jointly launched the &#39;Sammilit Sanatani Jagran Jote&#39;. A Rangpur divisional rally is scheduled to be held under the banner of this alliance today. Sanatan Jagran Mancha Rangpur coordinator Dipankar Bhattacharya told Prothom Alo that they have sought permission from the district administration to hold a rally at the district school ground.
