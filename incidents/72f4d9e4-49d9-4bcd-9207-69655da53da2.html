On Monday afternoon, August 5, at least 100 people entered the market in a group and carried out an ambush. Later, when they moved towards Sahaspur village adjacent to the market, they were stopped by people from the minority community. Later, they left after threatening to leave their homes.<br /> <br /> Eyewitness Hridoy Roy, a resident of Sahaspur village, said, &quot;The attackers started vandalizing as soon as they entered the market. Our shops were selectively vandalized. The attackers had sticks and sharp weapons in their hands. We fled from the shop. Later, they looted the goods in front of our eyes. We were heading towards the village. At that time, when all of us in the neighborhood stood in front, they left.&quot;</div> <div class="lead fw-bold">Involved Crimes</div> <div class="mb-4"> <ul class="list-group"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Shop Vandalism</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Loot</li> </ul> </div> <div class="lead fw-bold">Proofs</div> <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered mb-4"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0"> <div> <a href="https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/district/amh52jc85n" target="_blank">Proof on www.prothomalo.com</a> </div> </li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0"> <div> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xoDdnkitZJI6yOkNOZsd0YHEAfs9WhXR/view" target="_blank">Proof on drive.google.com</a> </div> </li> </ul> <div class="lead fw-bold">Victims</div> <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered mb-4"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0"> <div><div> <strong>Name:</strong> Hridoy Roy</div> <div> <strong>Suffered Crimes</strong> </div> <ul class="list-group"> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Shop Vandalism</li> <li class="list-group-item bg-light border-0 py-0">&bull; Loot</li> </ul> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </body> </html>
