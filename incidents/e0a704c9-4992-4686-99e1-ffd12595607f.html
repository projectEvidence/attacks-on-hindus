This has angered Hindu members of the association. Many have termed the incident as “religious hatred”. Such allegations were made at an Iftar party organized by Bangladesh Computer Samity Jessore branch at Case D Light Restaurant, JS Tower, Jessore on Saturday evening, March 22. Founder Chairman of Jessore branch Apu Saha said in a Facebook post at 12:14 pm on March 22, that I was the founder chairman of Jessore branch and elected chairman 3 times in a row. Also, many people after me have performed important duties in this organization with good reputation. Like every year, this year too, the association has organized an Iftar party. But the example set by the new leaders by causing such a hateful incident has brought the image of this organization to the bottom. He further said, for those of us who do computer business, the emotions towards this organization are on another level. Today is a shameful day in the history of Bangladesh Computer Association, Jessore branch. Today, beef Tehri was served at the Iftar party organized by the association. Out of the 58 members in the association, 22/23 are traditional religious people. He further said, I knew that those with whom I spent most of my life had competition in their minds about business, which is normal. However, I did not understand the hatred they had towards us. Former chairman of the association, Partha Pratim Debnath (Rati), admitted the truth of the incident and said, we, the traditionalists, started the Iftar mahfil in this computer association. Such an incident has not happened in any previous year. The matter is highly condemnable and we have strongly protested. In this regard, the current chairman of the association, Faruk Jahangir Ali Khan Tipu, did not respond to call to his mobile phone. However, when other members protested, he admitted his mistake and said that the people from the food committee did this without informing them.
