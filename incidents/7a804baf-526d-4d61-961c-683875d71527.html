They took away more than a hundred poultry, a goat, gold coins, cash, rice, pulses, oil, bamboo baskets or kulas, whatever they found in front of them from these houses. The attackers also opened the only deep tube well in the village.<br /> <br /> On that day, after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, a group of 40 to 50 people attacked the Hindupalli at around 6:30 pm.
