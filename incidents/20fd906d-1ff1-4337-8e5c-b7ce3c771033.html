    <strong>Notes</strong>:
    Father of Dipankar Biswas.<br />
<br />
Dipankar&#39;s father and former member of ward number 5 of Dhalgram Union Parishad, Kshitish Chandra Biswas (72), said that around 8 pm on August 5, about 150 people attacked his house with ramda, hansua, sticks, axes, iron rods and petrol-filled bottles. After vandalizing the house, they took four cows, 22 ducks, 12 chickens, 40 duck eggs, two sacks of rice and an electric motor. He and his wife were at home at the time of the attack. The miscreants demanded one lakh taka from them. If they did not give it, they threatened to pour petrol inside the house and set it on fire. He claims that he was saved by paying 50 thousand taka.</div>
