She was taken to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital around 5 pm on Tuesday, where doctors declared her dead. The deceased Mukti was the daughter of Nikhil Barman of Premnagar village in the upazila and a class 10 student of Premnagar Chalipura High School. The accused Kausar Mia (21) is the son of Shamsu Mia of the same village. Liton Barman, uncle of the deceased Mukti, said that Kausar had been harassing his niece for a long time on her way to and from school. The matter was also informed to her family. Today, Kausar injured Mukti on her way back from school. Later, she was rescued and taken to Barhatta Upazila Health Complex, where doctors sent her to Netrokona Modern Sadar Hospital after providing primary treatment. From there, she was declared dead after being taken to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital. Mukti&#39;s elder sister Rujina Rani Barman has claimed that Kausar used to harass Mukti Rani. She said, &quot;Kausar used to harass me too. Due to his threats, I got admitted to Netrokona Adarsh ​​High School after passing fifth grade. I tried to take legal action against Kausar&#39;s father Shamsur, but it did not work. After I left, he started harassing my sister. Kausar is killing my sister because he did not listen to her. I want justice for this.&quot; Mukti&#39;s classmates said that they were returning home from school together at around 2:45 pm today. After reaching the Chalipura area, about two kilometers away from the school, Mukti suddenly started hitting her with a crowbar. At this time, they got scared and started screaming. Local people rushed to rescue Mukti and took her to Barhatta Hospital. Abul Khair Akand, headmaster of Premnagar Chalipura High School, said that Mukti&#39;s family is very poor. The girl was calm and intelligent. She was a student of the humanities branch. The matter is very tragic. We demand the immediate arrest of the scoundrel and exemplary punishment. Barhatta Police Station Officer-in-Charge Khokon Kumar Saha said that the police are conducting raids at various places to arrest the accused. The body of the deceased has been kept in the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College.
