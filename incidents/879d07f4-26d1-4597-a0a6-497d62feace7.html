The incident took place on Thursday (December 5) night. After learning about the incident on Friday morning, the police detained one person for questioning. It is learned that 8-10 Hindu families in Nasibpur village have established a public temple in a tin hut and have been performing annual Kali Puja and daily puja for a long time. At some point on Thursday night, miscreants entered the temple and partially broke the hands of the Kali idol and the heads of the Dakini and Yogini idols. They also tried to set the Kali idol on fire by placing the hair on the floor. Although some of the hair burned, the fire did not spread around. The residents of the village came to know about the matter on Friday morning. On receiving the information, Additional Superintendent of Police Saheb Ali Pathan, Sadar Upazila Executive Officer (UNO) Asma Binte Rafique, District Puja Celebration Committee President Gyanesh Sarkar, police, law enforcement and administration officials along with the police station visited the spot. Eyewitnesses said that there was no lock on the door of the temple. It was in a very unprotected state. No one could say anything about who did this. A person named Nitai Sutradhar filed a complaint with the police station on behalf of the villagers. District Puja Celebration Committee President Gyanesh Sarkar said that the incident is highly condemnable. Someone may have done this with the intention of tarnishing our communal harmony and the image of the government. He demanded a fair investigation into the matter. Additional Superintendent of Police Saheb Ali Pathan said that the incident is being investigated. If evidence of anyone&#39;s involvement is found in the investigation, legal action will be taken. However, one person has been initially detained for questioning. UNO Asma Binte Rafiq said that unknown assailants have partially broken some idols in the temple. Law enforcement agencies are investigating the incident.
