In response, on Tuesday evening, November 5, angry people from the Hindu community surrounded his shop. During this, a joint force of police and army attacked Hindus. Later, the army conducted another raid in Hazari Gali until 11:30 pm and broke CCTV cameras indiscriminately. During the joint force&#39;s raid in that area, pictures of massive lathicharge and beatings were spread on social media. There have been allegations of oppression of people from the Hindu community over this incident. In particular, the issue of breaking the CCTV cameras of the joint force members during the raid has raised questions. Discussion and criticism are going on on social media. Then, 82 detainees were taken to WASA Dampara army camp and beaten overnight. The next day, Wednesday night, the police held a court and sent 49 people to jail in this incident. The remaining 33 people, who were under 15 and over 55 years of age and were not found to be involved in the incident, were said to have been released in the custody of their guardians. In this incident, Kotwali Police Station SI Mizanur Rahman filed a case on charges of obstructing government work, assaulting police and throwing acid. 49 people, including 500-600 unknown people, have been accused in the case. All of the 49 arrested are from the Hindu community.” The army sealed every shop in Hazari Gali that night. Three days later, when the army opened the CCTV hard disk of every shop, it was arrested. Even Mana Das, who had gone to collect medicine for her wife, who was undergoing treatment for cancer at Chittagong Medical College, was arrested and sent to jail. Later, when the media published news about the incident under the headline &quot;What will Mana&#39;s wife&#39;s ten-year-old son do now?&quot;, she was granted bail after 25 days. Hindus who joined the protest were beaten like dogs in the name of the operation." /> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
