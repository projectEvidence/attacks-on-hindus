During the press conference, Sadhan, the son of the affected family, stated in a written speech that despite a court injunction, Abu Sayed and others have forcibly taken control of our land and shop. We have a case in court with an injunction in place. Yesterday, Wednesday at 11 AM, three to four hundred armed goons attacked my father, and when people from home tried to save my father, they also attacked them, causing two individuals to be severely injured and hospitalized. They claimed the land was khas (govt owned land)and occupied our shop, but in reality, the land of the shop house is not khas; its plot number is 1526, which is currently in litigation in court. We have been responding to the lawsuit. Today, they unexpectedly attacked and seized our store. They have previously threatened us with various forms of intimidation, and even Abu Saeed and his group are threatening us to leave for India and are also threatening to torture us with various lawsuits. Despite a court injunction, we are seeking assistance from the authorities on how they illegally entered our property. In this regard, Abu Saeed&#39;s son, Mizan, stated that their accusations are false, fabricated, and baseless. Khondakar Shaker Ahmed, the officer in charge of Bakshiganj police station, said that upon receiving the news, we sent police to the scene and the situation is under control. If a written complaint is received, legal action will be taken against the offenders based on the investigation."> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.5.13/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script> </head> <body class="bg-light text-black" style="max-width:960px; margin: 1cm auto;"> <div id="app"> <div class="container-md my-4 p-4 text-center"> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.bn" :href="homePage.bn">বাংলা হোম পেজ</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.hi" :href="homePage.hi">हिंदी होम पेज</a> <a translate="no" :class="langBtnClasses.en" :href="homePage.en">English Home Page</a> </div> <div class="container-md my-4"> <div class="m-1 p-4 border border-info rounded"> <div class="fs-2 text-center text-info">We need volunteers!</div> <div class="p-4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;"> We need volunteers to input incidents of attacks against Hindus and religious/ethnic minorities in Bangladesh.
